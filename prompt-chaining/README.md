# Prompt Chaining

## Overview

Prompt Chaining is a powerful technique that connects multiple prompts in sequence, where each prompt builds upon the output of the previous ones. This enables complex, multi-step workflows that can tackle sophisticated tasks by breaking them down into manageable, sequential operations.

## How It Works

Prompt chaining operates through a sequential pipeline:

1. **Initial Input**: Start with base information or requirements
2. **Chain Execution**: Each step processes and transforms the input
3. **State Passing**: Outputs from one step become inputs for the next
4. **Final Assembly**: All intermediate results combine into final output
5. **Quality Control**: Each step can validate and refine previous work

## Key Components

### 1. Chain Steps
Individual prompts that perform specific tasks:
- **Specialized Purpose**: Each step has a clear, focused objective
- **Input/Output Definition**: Clear data flow between steps
- **Template System**: Reusable prompt templates with variable substitution
- **Configuration**: Customizable parameters per step

### 2. Variable Management
Dynamic data flow through the chain:
- **Variable Passing**: Outputs become variables for subsequent steps
- **State Preservation**: Maintain context across the entire chain
- **Template Substitution**: Dynamic prompt generation based on variables
- **Context Building**: Accumulate knowledge as the chain progresses

### 3. Execution Engine
Orchestrates the entire workflow:
- **Sequential Processing**: Execute steps in defined order
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure management
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor chain execution status
- **Result Aggregation**: Collect and organize all outputs

## Key Benefits

- ✅ **Complex Task Decomposition**: Break large problems into manageable steps
- ✅ **Quality Progression**: Each step refines and improves the work
- ✅ **Specialized Processing**: Different steps can use different strategies
- ✅ **Reusable Components**: Chain steps can be reused across workflows
- ✅ **Transparent Process**: Clear visibility into each transformation
- ✅ **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to add, remove, or modify steps

    name: str
    prompt_template: str
    system_message: str = "You are a helpful assistant."
    temperature: float = 0.7
    max_tokens: int = 800
    output_key: str = "output"

class PromptChain:
    def add_step(self, step: ChainStep):
        """Add a step to the chain"""
        
    def set_variable(self, key: str, value: str):
        """Set variables for the chain"""
        
    def execute(self, initial_input: str = ""):
        """Execute the entire chain"""
```

## Chain Design Patterns

### 1. Linear Pipeline
Simple sequential processing:
```
Input → Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 → Output
```

### 2. Refinement Chain
Iterative improvement:
```
Draft → Review → Revise → Polish → Final
```

### 3. Analysis-Synthesis Chain
Break down then build up:
```
Problem → Analyze → Research → Synthesize → Recommend
```

### 4. Validation Chain
Quality assurance at each step:
```
Create → Validate → Correct → Review → Approve
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Step Design
- **Single Responsibility**: Each step should have one clear purpose
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define exact inputs and outputs for each step
- **Error Handling**: Plan for failures and edge cases
- **Idempotency**: Steps should produce consistent results

### 2. Variable Management
- **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, meaningful variable names
- **Consistent Format**: Standardize data formats across steps
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain important information throughout
- **State Validation**: Verify data integrity between steps

### 3. Chain Architecture
- **Logical Flow**: Ensure steps build naturally on each other
- **Modularity**: Design reusable, interchangeable components
- **Flexibility**: Allow for optional steps and branching
- **Monitoring**: Track execution progress and performance

### 4. Quality Control
- **Validation Steps**: Include quality checks throughout the chain
- **Rollback Capability**: Allow returning to previous steps if needed
- **Human Review Points**: Enable manual intervention when necessary
- **Output Verification**: Validate final results against requirements

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Conditional Branching
```python
if condition:
    chain.add_step(detailed_analysis_step)
else:
    chain.add_step(summary_step)
```

### 2. Parallel Processing
Execute multiple chains simultaneously and merge results:
```python
# Run multiple analysis chains in parallel
market_chain = create_market_analysis_chain()
technical_chain = create_technical_analysis_chain()
# Merge results in final step
```

### 3. Dynamic Chain Generation
Build chains based on input characteristics:
```python
def create_adaptive_chain(input_type, complexity_level):
    chain = PromptChain()
    if complexity_level == "high":
        chain.add_step(detailed_research_step)
    # Add steps based on requirements
    return chain
```

### 4. Chain Composition
Combine smaller chains into larger workflows:
```python
research_chain = create_research_chain()
analysis_chain = create_analysis_chain()
full_chain = combine_chains(research_chain, analysis_chain)
```

## Error Handling and Recovery

### 1. Step-Level Errors
- **Retry Logic**: Attempt failed steps multiple times
- **Fallback Steps**: Alternative approaches for failed steps
- **Error Context**: Preserve information about failures
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue chain with partial results

### 2. Chain-Level Errors
- **Checkpoint System**: Save intermediate results
- **Resume Capability**: Restart from last successful step
- **Partial Results**: Return best available output
- **Error Reporting**: Detailed failure analysis

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Parallel Execution
- Execute independent steps simultaneously
- Batch API calls where possible
- Use async processing for I/O operations

### 2. Caching and Memoization
- Cache expensive operations
- Reuse results from similar inputs
- Store intermediate computations

### 3. Resource Management
- Monitor token usage across steps
- Optimize prompt lengths
- Balance quality vs. cost

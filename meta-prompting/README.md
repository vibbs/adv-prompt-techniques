# Meta Prompting

## Overview

Meta Prompting is an advanced technique where AI systems are used to optimize and generate better prompts. This creates a self-improving prompting ecosystem where artificial intelligence helps design more effective prompts for various tasks, leading to improved results through automated optimization and refinement.
